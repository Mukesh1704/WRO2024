# WRO Freising 2024 - Team Katherlstrophe EV3 Robot Strategy

## Overview
Our robot is strategically designed to navigate the competition field efficiently, following a systematic approach to complete tasks in the WRO Freising 2024 challenges.

## Task Sequence
1. **Navigation near Green House:**
   - Move left when near the green house on the playing field.
   - Collect gray debris.
   - Collect yellow debris.
   - Collect the second yellow debris.
   - Deliver all collected debris.

2. **House Construction Phase:**
   - Construct the first house (red).
   - Construct the yellow house.

3. **Power Grid Activation:**
   - Activate the power line in the bridge section of the map.
   - Cross the bridge to collect green/blue objects and retrieve the gray brick after delivery.

4. **Second Power Grid Activation:**
   - Activate the second power line.
   - Continue construction at the blue/green houses.

## Usage
Adapt and fine-tune the code to execute the specified sequence accurately. Customize the robot's movements, sensor interactions, and decision-making processes to optimize performance during each task.

## Contribution
This strategy is tailored for Team Katherlstrophe's unique approach. Commits should be made exclusively to the main branch. Feel free to experiment and contribute enhancements to the code.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the EV3 community and WRO organizers for their inspiration and support in developing this strategic approach.

Best of luck to Team Katherlstrophe at WRO Freising 2024! ðŸ¤–
