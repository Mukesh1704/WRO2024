# EV3 Robot for WRO Freising 2024 - Team Katherlstrophe

## Overview
Welcome to our EV3 Robot project designed for the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) in Freising 2024. This repository contains the code and documentation for our competition robot.

## Description
Our robot is built using the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 platform and is specifically tailored for the challenges presented at WRO 2024 in EichstÃ¤tt. The project focuses on delivering efficient and precise performance in various tasks, showcasing the versatility of the EV3 system.

## Features
- Modular code structure for easy customization and expansion
- Optimized algorithms for accurate sensor readings and precise movements
- Integration with sensors such as color sensors, gyro sensors, and ultrasonic sensors
- Well-commented code to facilitate understanding and modification

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Connect your EV3 brick to your computer and upload the code.
3. Run the main program on the EV3 brick.

## Requirements
- LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 set
- EV3 software for programming (compatible with [ev3dev](https://www.ev3dev.org/) if desired)
- Various sensors (color, gyro, ultrasonic) for enhanced functionality

## Usage
Customize the code to match the specific challenges and requirements of the WRO 2024 competition. Experiment with different sensor configurations and algorithm adjustments to optimize performance.

## Contribution
Please note that this repository is exclusively for Team Katherlstrophe. Feel free to fork this repository for experimentation and development.


## Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to the EV3 community and the WRO organizers for inspiring and supporting us throughout the development of this project.
